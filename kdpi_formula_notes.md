# KDPI Formula Notes from OPTN Guide (Updated April 21, 2025)

## Overview
- KDPI combines 8 donor factors into a single number
- KDPI is derived by first calculating KDRI (Kidney Donor Risk Index)
- KDPI maps KDRI to a cumulative percentage scale (0-100%)
- Lower KDPI = better donor quality and expected longevity

## Key Points
- Reference donor for KDRI: age 40, non-diabetic (50th percentile)
- A scaled KDRI of 1.28 = 1.28x risk of graft failure vs median donor
- As of October 31, 2024: Race and HCV status removed from formula

## Need to find the exact formula coefficients on subsequent pages


## KDRI Donor Factors (8 factors after October 2024 refit)
1. Age
2. Height
3. Weight
4. History of Hypertension
5. History of Diabetes
6. Cause of Death
7. Serum Creatinine
8. Donation after Circulatory Death (DCD) Status

## Table 1. KDRI Donor Factors and Model Coefficients
| Donor Characteristic | Applies to Which Donors | KDRI Coefficient (β) | KDRI Xβ Component |
|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Age (integer years) | All | 0.0092 | 0.0092*(Age-40) |
| Age < 18 | Age < 18 | 0.0113 | 0.0113*(Age-18) |
