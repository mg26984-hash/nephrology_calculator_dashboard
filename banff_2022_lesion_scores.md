# Banff 2022 Lesion Scores

## Banff Lesion Score i (Interstitial Inflammation)
This score evaluates the degree of inflammation in non-scarred areas of cortex, which is often a marker of Acute T Cell-Mediated Rejection (TCMR).

- **i0** — No inflammation or in less than 10% of unscarred cortical parenchyma
- **i1** — Inflammation in 10 to 25% of unscarred cortical parenchyma
- **i2** — Inflammation in 26 to 50% of unscarred cortical parenchyma
- **i3** — Inflammation in more than 50% of unscarred cortical parenchyma

Note: An asterisk should be added to Banff Lesion Score i (e.g., i1*), "if there are more than 5% to 10% of eosinophils, neutrophils or plasma cells".

## Banff Lesion Score t (Tubulitis)
This Banff Lesion Score evaluates the degree of inflammation within the epithelium of the cortical tubules. "Tubulitis—the presence of mononuclear cells in the basolateral aspect of the renal tubule epithelium" is one of the defining lesion of TCMR in kidney transplants.

According to Banff 1997, in tubules cut longitudinally, the score shall be determined as the number of mononuclear cells per 10 tubular epithelial cells, which is the average number of epithelial cells per tubular cross-section.

- **t0** — No mononuclear cells in tubules
- **t1** — Foci with 1-4 mononuclear cells per tubular cross-section (or per 10 tubular epithelial cells)
- **t2** — Foci with 5-10 mononuclear cells per tubular cross-section (or per 10 tubular epithelial cells)
- **t3** — Foci with >10 mononuclear cells per tubular cross-section (or per 10 tubular epithelial cells), or the presence of ≥2 areas of tubular basement membrane destruction accompanied by i2/i3 inflammation and t2 tubulitis elsewhere in the biopsy
